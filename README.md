### Sanad
Sanad is a handy DNS changer tool for Gnome. It makes switching DNS settings within the Gnome desktop environment a breeze. I created it to provide a straightforward and efficient way to manage DNS configurations, which can help improve both security and browsing speed.

Check out the project on [GitHub](https://github.com/MirS0bhan/sanad) and the [Gnome Extensions page](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7861/sanad/).
